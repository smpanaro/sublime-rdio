Rdio for Sublime 1.0 Changelog

Thanks for installing Rdio for Sublime!  

Check out the settings in Preferences -> Package Settings -> Rdio for some small configuration tweaks.  

When you want to search for artists or albums, prepend your searches with "artist:" or "album:".
e.g. Typing "album: Daft Punk" in the search box, will list albums by Daft Punk.
